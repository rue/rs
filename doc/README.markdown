 Acknowledgements
==================

The original spark was provided by Reyn Vlietstra's ruSH back in 2005.
It was an excellent implementation of a novel concept, and I thoroughly
enjoyed working on it. The first incarnation of rs was a complete rewrite
effort of ruSH, and now I am starting from scratch again. Thanks to Reyn
and all the other collaborators on ruSH and the earlier rs.
